# Web Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based web vulnerability scanner that crawls a target website, identifies all forms and links, and tests them for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This project demonstrates how to interact with web pages, handle forms, and identify potential security issues.

## Features

- Crawls a specified target URL and identifies all internal links and forms.
- Tests all discovered forms and links for XSS vulnerabilities.
- Handles login to the target website to perform authenticated scanning.
- Ignores specified links during the crawling process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `urllib3`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Web-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Web-Vulnerability-Scanner
    ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    requests
    beautifulsoup4
    urllib3
    ```

## Usage

1. Update the `Vulnerability_scanner.py` file with your target URL and login credentials:
    ```python
    target_url = "http://your-target-url.com/"
    links_to_ignore = ["http://your-target-url.com/logout.php"]

    data_dict = {"username": "your-username", "password": "your-password", "Login": "submit"}

    vuln_scanner = scanner.Scanner(target_url, links_to_ignore)
    vuln_scanner.session.post("http://your-target-url.com/login.php", data=data_dict)

    vuln_scanner.crawl()
    vuln_scanner.run_scanner()
    ```

2. Run the scanner:
    ```sh
    python Vulnerability_scanner.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `scanner.py`: Contains the `Scanner` class that handles crawling, form extraction, link extraction, and XSS testing.
- `Vulnerability_scanner.py`: Initializes the scanner with target URL and login credentials, starts the crawling and scanning process.
